TypeScript OOP Project

Welcome to this TypeScript project where we explore Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using TypeScript. 

Overview
The objective of this project is to demonstrate how to use TypeScript to implement OOP principles. By defining classes such as BaseCar and Person classes, we showcase inheritance, encapsulation, and other key OOP features.
